  "description": "This is a proposal for a method to define linear and nonlinear narrative 'trails' of content using the [Web Annotation Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/).\r The goal is to permit a 'Memex-like' application where users 'bookmark' content in a local database which provides a searchable index and UI allowing [Entries](Entry.md) to be combined into [Collections](Collection.md), which in turn can be referenced in each [Step](Step.md) of a greater narrative [Trail](Trail.md). The elements of this model should be sufficiently decoupled as to allow remixing [Entries](Entry.md) and [Collections](Collection.md) into other narrative [Trails](Trail.md).\r The model makes use of 'meta-annotations' (annotations targeting annotations) to create the proposed structures.",
